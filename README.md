# Streamflow Forecasting Comparison

Forecasting streamflow based on past data is very crucial in flood control and helps in water resources management. The code in this repo 
aims at comparing the performance of single models(currently SVR) in forecasting streamflow for different wavelets used for data
decomposition.
